# Independent_Project_Atighetchi


For my final project, I decided to visualize some of the data from my Thesis/Dissertation and potentially use these visualizations in my thesis!!


## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or SLE is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by systemic inflammation and damage to tissues. 
The genetic basis of this disease is not well studied in individuals of differing ancestries, and so my thesis focuses on broadening 
this disparity by including a large cohort of diverse ancestries including those of Hispanic ethnicity, European/White, Asian, African Americans
, and others to investigate the genetic and chronic factors associated with an increased risk in SLE.

This project is a culmination of my thesis work and so will include much of the data and analysis behind my thesis work
